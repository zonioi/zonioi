### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Science
 - Propagation of muons underground using the FLUKA Monte Carlo toolkit.
 - Work on postdoctoral research focused on the reduction of the systematic un-
certaininties stemming from the high-energy hadronic interaction models, and
muon propagation processes.
- Analysis of the observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory, and from
NovA experiment.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning how to deal with all life variables, meanwhile:
     - Data Science in the Barcelona ITAcademy,
     - Data Science and Analytics at Universidade SÃ£o Paulo
- :bowtie:
 - Omdena collaborator, IA by the people, for the people!
